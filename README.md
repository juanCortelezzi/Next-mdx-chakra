# Juan's Blog

Hey there, this is my blog. It's built with `Next.js` for the Server side
generation, `Chakra-ui` for sake of not dealing with css and `Markdown` files
that conform the blog pages.

### known issues

I believe this project has some npm dependency issues with the remark library
which is used for rendering markdown and codeblocks.
